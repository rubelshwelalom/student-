# StudentPortfolio DApp

## Vision
The **StudentPortfolio** DApp is designed to allow students to create and manage their personal portfolios on the Ethereum blockchain. Each student can document their achievements, skills, and a description of their portfolio. This decentralized application provides a secure and immutable way for students to showcase their credentials and track their progress over time.

## Flowchart
Below is a simplified flowchart of the primary interactions within the **StudentPortfolio** contract:

```
+-------------------+            +--------------------+            +-----------------------+
|                   |            |                    |            |                       |
|  User Creates     |            |  Contract Stores   |            |  Portfolio Created    |
|  Portfolio        +----------->+  Portfolio Data    +----------->+  Success Message      |
|                   |            |                    |            |                       |

|  User Adds        |            |  Contract Updates  |            |  Achievement Added    |

|  User Requests    |            |  Contract Returns  |            |  Portfolio Data       |
|  Portfolio Data   +----------->+  Portfolio Data    +----------->+  Displayed to User     |
|                   |            |                    |            |                       |
+-------------------+            +--------------------+            +-----------------------+
```

## Contract Address
The current deployed contract address on the Ethereum network (Rinkeby Testnet) is:

```
0xf4a608bf00621c1f2b8b9ac5fddda937addc20e3
```

Replace `0xYourContractAddressHere` with the actual address after deployment.

## Future Scope
- **Enhanced Security**: Implement role-based access controls to allow for permissioned updates.
- **User Verification**: Integrate with external systems to verify and validate student credentials.
- **Multilingual Support**: Add support for multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
- **User Interface**: Develop a front-end application to interact with the contract through a user-friendly interface.
